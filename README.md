# Timeline plugin for Omeka

The Timeline plugin, by the [Scholars' Lab][1] at the University of
Virginia Library, allows you to create timelines for the [Omeka][2] publishing
platform. It uses the [TimeGlider jQuery plugin][3].

## Installation

1. Upload the Timeline plugin directory to your Omeka installation's 'plugins'
directory. See [Installing a Plugin][4].

2. Activate the plugin from the admin → Settings → Plugins page.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
